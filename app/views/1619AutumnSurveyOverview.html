      <p class="govuk-body">
          Currently, we do not have any indication of likely participation numbers in-year until December when R04 data become available. 
          There is an increasingly strong drive to understand 16-19 participation earlier in the academic year, to help us track progress on the government's Opportunity Mission, monitor the likely financial position for the academic year, and make better decisions about directing funding as necessary. 

          This survey could significantly help planning by giving us earlier insight into likely student numbers. The survey, while not compulsory, would need your internal sign-off in the usual way. We will not use the information to make any decisions about your funding. We will assess the data at an aggregate level, however, we would ask for returns to have the same level of rigour as a formal return.
