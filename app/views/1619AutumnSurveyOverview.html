          We need to know the estimate of your 16-19 student numbers ahead of the R04 collection return. 
      </p>


      <p class="govuk-body">
          Currently, we do not have any indication of 16-19 student numbers until December when the R04 collection return closes. 
      </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">There is an increasingly strong drive to understand 16-19 participation earlier in the academic year in order to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>help us track progress on the government's Opportunity Mission</li>
        <li>monitor the likely financial position for the academic year</li>
        <li>inform better policy decision making as necessary</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            Therefore, during R02 and again at R03, we are asking you to provide an estimate of your 16-19 student numbers for the current academic year.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">This collection will not be used to make any decisions about your funding.</p>
        </ul>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Calculating and submitting your estimate</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
          An online form is available for you to submit your estimate.
      </p>


           <p class="govuk-body">Your estimate should include 16-19 students that:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>will have at least one funding model 25 and source of funding 107 learning aims</li>
        <li>will meet the criteria to count as a start for funding purposes (see related content)</li>
        <li>will have an earliest start date on or before the 1 November 2025</li>
        <li>will fall within one of these 4 funding line types:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>19+ Continuing Students (excluding EHCP)</li>
            <li>19-24 Students with an EHCP</li>
            <li>16-19 High Needs Students</li>
            <li>16-19 Students (excluding High Needs Students)</li>
        </ul>
        </ul> 

     <p class="govuk-body">
          Your estimate should not include 14-16 direct funded students.
