    <p class="govuk-body">
        We need to know the estimate of your teacher Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) numbers ahead of the full Further Education Workforce Data Collection (FEWDC).
    </p>


    <p class="govuk-body">
         Currently, we do not have an indication of teacher workforce numbers until later in the year when the FEWDC return closes.
    </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">There is an increasingly strong drive to understand workforce numbers earlier in the academic year in order to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>act as a leading indicator for progress toward the 6,500 teacher recruitment target</li>
        <li>provide basic statistics on how teacher numbers are changing throughout the academic year</li>
        <li>inform decision making earlier in the academic year</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
         Therefore, between <strong>Monday 2 February and Monday 16 February</strong>, we are asking you to provide a snapshot of your teacher FTE for the current academic year.
      </p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Calculating and submitting your estimate</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
          An online form is available for you to submit your estimate.
      </p>


       <p class="govuk-body">Your estimate should include <strong>FTE</strong> for staff that:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>are employed as <strong>teachers</strong></li>
        <li>are on <strong>permanent</strong> or <strong>fixed-term</strong> contracts</li>
        <li>were employed on the snapshot date of <strong>19 January</strong></li>
      </ul> 

      <p class="govuk-body">This collection applies to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>General FE Colleges (incl. Tertiary)</li>
        <li>Sixth Form Colleges</li>
        <li>School-based providers (e.g. converted 16-19 academies)</li>
      </ul>

     <p class="govuk-body">
         Your estimate should <strong>not</strong> include staff from Independent Training Providers (ITPs), Special Post-16 institutions, or Local Authority providers.
      </p>
