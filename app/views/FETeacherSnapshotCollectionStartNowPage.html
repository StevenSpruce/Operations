    <p class="govuk-body">    
              The Department for Education (DfE) is introducing this in-year data collection of teacher full-time equivalent (FTE) numbers to monitor teacher numbers more effectively. This will  provide a timely in-year view of teacher numbers, helping DfE to monitor workforce trends.  It will also inform policy and guide future decisions on targeted support and investment for colleges.
