              The 6,500 additional teachers target is the UK government's commitment to increase the number of teachers in England’s state-funded secondary schools and further education (FE) colleges by 6,500 by the end of the current Parliament (Spring 2029).
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              The Department for Education (DfE) is introducing this in-year data collection of teacher full-time equivalent (FTE) numbers to monitor teacher numbers more effectively. This will allow us to track progress toward the pledge for 6,500 additional teachers and guide future decisions on targeted support and investment for colleges.
